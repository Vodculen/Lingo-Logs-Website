					<h3 class="subsection">Pros of Lingo Logs:</h3>
					<ul class="listings">
						<li>
							<p class="listingstext"><b>No Advertisements:</b> Unlike other language learning software, Lingo Logs has no advertisements around its website and software. This will make your time learning a language more enjoyable and have less distractions.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="listingstext"><b>No Subscriptions:</b> You get everything that the Lingo Logs have to offer without having pay at all. Nothing is behind a paywall... Except for a badge you get from donating to us, so Lingo Logs can stay online and teach.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="listingstext"><b>No Fixed Path:</b> With other language software you are put on a fixed tree where the order of what you learn is fixed. Lingo Logs avoids this with allowing you to pick what to learn and make your own path.</p>
						</li>
						<!-- Add later when features actually come to the Desktop Software -->
						<!-- <li>
							<p class="listingstext"><b>Chat With Learners & Natives:</b> This allows you to get help or talk about the language. This can help make learning a second language easier and more enjoyable. Plus you will get introduced to many more things.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="listingstext"><b>Teach or Attend Classes:</b> Lingo Logs allows you to boost your language learning even further by talking to a native or a teacher who knows the language. Even you can become a teacher to help others learn a language.</p>
						</li> -->
						<li>
							<p class="listingstext"><b>Extensive Practice:</b> If you thought that only reading text and taking online courses are it then you are wrong. Lingo Logs has a practices section that includes: Flashcards, Speaking, Reading, Writing, and Listening exercises.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="rightSide">
					<h3 class="subsection">Cons of Lingo Logs:</h3>
					<ul class="listings">
						<li>
							<p class="listingstext"><b>Limited Amount of Languages:</b> Lingo Logs currently doesn't support every popular language yet. But with time and updates Lingo Logs will have more and more languages for all of you who want to learn rarer languages.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="listingstext"><b>NOT Game Like:</b> While Lingo Logs dose share ideas from Duolingo. Lingo Logs doesn't make learning a language as game like as Duolingo. But, if you prefer something more game like, just use Duolingo.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="listingstext"><b>In Early Beta:</b> Right now Lingo Logs is in early Beta. Meaning that not every feature will be package in Lingo Logs right now. Eventually all the features will be fully fleshed out and added to Lingo Logs.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="listingstext"><b>Not 100% Perfect:</b> Since the team at Lingo Logs is very tiny right now. We rely many users translations and interpretations to help fleshing out the languages. This can lead to mis interpenetration and translations.</p>
